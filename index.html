        <h2> About Myself </h2>
        <p> I have been working as an Economist and a Financier since I graduated from the university 9 years ago. 
            Last year I decided to change my career path and try to become a developer because of its multiple opportunities. 
            I quitted my job and gave myself a year to learn new skills.
            In fact, I got to love coding and do not regret my decision. 
            For now, I do not have any choice but make myself a top developer.
