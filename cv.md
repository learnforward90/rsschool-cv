## About Myself: ##
---
I have been working as an Economist and a Financier since I graduated from the university 9 years ago. Last year I decided to change my career path and try to become a developer because of its multiple opportunities.
I quitted my job and gave myself a year to learn new skills. In fact, I got to love coding and do not regret my decision.
For now, I do not have any choice but make myself a top developer.
